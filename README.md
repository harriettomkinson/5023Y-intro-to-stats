# 5023Y-intro-to-stats
An introduction to statistics, coded in R.

# Brief Introduction

This project follows a beginner learning about statistical models (including linear models) in R whilst studying on the 5023Y Data Science for Biologists module. 

# The Data

The data used is Darwin's Maize data, obtained by Darwin himself when he produced seeds of maize (Zea mays). The seeds were either fertilised with pollen from the same or from a different plant. The heights of the seedlings produced were measured as a proxy for their relative evolutionary fitness.

Darwin's hypothesis was based around whether inbreeding reduced the fitness of the selfed plants. 

Some of the statistical analysis in this project assesses Darwin's original hypothesis.

# Other Information

Posit cloud was used to code in R.

Given this was done by a beginner, it contains simple explanatory comments throughout, and should be easy to follow.
