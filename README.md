# 5023Y-intro-to-stats
An introduction to statistics, coded in R.

# Brief Introduction

This project follows a beginner learning about statistical models (including linear models) in R whilst studying on the 5023Y Data Science for Biologists module. 



# The Data

The data used is Darwin's Maize data, obtained by Darwin himself when he produced seeds of maize (Zea mays). The seeds were either fertilised with pollen from the same or from a different plant. The heights of the seedlings produced were measured as a proxy for their relative evolutionary fitness.Darwin's hypothesis was based around whether inbreeding reduced the fitness of the selfed plants. Some of the statistical analysis in this project assesses Darwin's original hypothesis.

Additionally, in the regression script, Janka data was used. This example data was taken from the Australian forestry industry and 36 samples of wood from different tree species, their density and hardness was recorded. Density is defined as 'the amount of force required to embed a 0.444" steel ball into the wood to half of its diameter'. Timber hardness is quantified using the 'Janka scale', thus the name of the data. 

# What is Included in this Project?

In addition to basic statistical testing and plotting results found, an introduction to linear models has been investigated. T-testing has also been included, which includes Student t-test and paired t-tests. Type 1 and Type 2 errors have also been considered. Furthermore, an introduction to Regression has been carried out, including linear regression. In the regression script, the Janka data was used, not the Darwin data. 

# Other Information

Posit cloud was used to code in R.

Given this was done by a beginner, it contains simple explanatory comments throughout, and should be easy to follow.
